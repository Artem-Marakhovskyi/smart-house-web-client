  "Smart House" is a House control system. It provides supervision of whole
  house devices. Due to our application any client can turn on/off the Devices
  remotеly, get statistics from the Sensors and get access to some basic
  functionality. The Core of our system is a combination of Devices and Sensors
  what interact between each other through the Hub(Server). The Web and Mobile
  clients were implemented in our application too. Clients get control over
  Devices and Sensors via WebAPI.
